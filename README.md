# RedWineQualityPrediction
Red Wine Quality Prediction

  Welcome to the Red Wine Quality Prediction project on GitHub! In this project, we will be building a machine learning model to predict the quality of red wines based on their chemical properties. The goal of this project is to explore different machine learning techniques, experiment with feature engineering, and ultimately build a model that can accurately predict the quality of wine.
